Libraries for Tabletop Simulator

This is a collection of libraries that I have written for Tabletop Simulator scripting. 

There should be a small README in all folders. Feel free to open issues and pull requests.

To use these either copy paste the file contents into your lua files, or even better setup an include path and put them into a libs folder. You can then use them like
```
#include "libs/gameObjectHelper"
```
